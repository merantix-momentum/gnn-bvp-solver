# Source code for paper "Learning the Solution Operator of Boundary Value Problems using Graph Neural Networks".

## Using the data
The data is stored publicly in google buckets in `requester-pays` mode. To access the data and train your models, you need to [include a billing project](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/using-requester-pays#using).

## Use weights & biases:
We use weights & biases for logging and experiment tracking. You can create your free account [here](https://wandb.ai/).
Use `wandb login` to login from your python environment as described [here](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart).

## Run training:
Make sure all requirements are installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
If you have trouble installing PyTorch Geometric on your machine make sure to follow the [official instructions](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html). 
In the config folder, training scripts are provided for all experiments in the paper.
An example command would be:

```
python -m gnn_bvp_solver.app --config configs/task_shape/es_ma.json --dry_run --no-gpu 
```

## Test a model:
Look for the model you want to test in the weight & biases [artifact store](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts).
The best and latest model will be automatically tagged for each run. Pass `test` as task and the model artifact.
It is important to use the same config like for training.
An example command would be:

```
python -m gnn_bvp_solver.app --task test --artifact model-aer8oj02:v1 --config configs/task_shape/es_ma.json --no-gpu
```
